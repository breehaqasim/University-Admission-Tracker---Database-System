# University-Admission-Tracker---Database-System
The University Admission Tracker Database Management System is an ambitious project
aimed at simplifying the complex process of applying to universities. Its primary scope is to
create an accessible and user-friendly platform for students to search for universities in a
specific country and city, while also allowing them to refine their choices based on admission
criteria such as SAT scores, academic records, and other relevant factors and also can contact
counselors. This platform is designed to simplify the complex process of exploring and selecting
universities for students amidst preparations for their boards/CAIEâ€™s. By doing so, it not only
saves time but also facilitates the process of narrowing down options, making it easier for each
student to find their ideal university.
This system aims to provide students with a powerful tool to make informed decisions about
their higher education journey by offering detailed university profiles that include critical
information like admission prerequisites, university type, average annual cost of university,
acceptance rate, application deadlines, campus locations, website link and contact details.
By encompassing these features, this project aims to empower students and streamline their
university application process, ultimately helping them find the institutions where they best fit
and meet the admission requirements.
